# Basic responsive to keystroke Drum Kit made with vanilla javascript

Description: Using keycodes for recognition of key pressed, the program uses querySelector to match elements and then plays the corresponding audio file with .play() method. While being played there will be a yellow border around the corresponding box indicating that it's being played.




I'm just practicing vanilla javascript with no external lib/frameworks.

This is the first of many projects.
